Self-Assesment Exercises: Basic programming

**Questions:**

1.	Write functions that take a matrix M of size N × N as an input and calculate the following quantities: 
    a)	The trace of the matrix. 
    b)	The sum, mean and maximum of the entries. 
    c)	The sum, mean and maximum of the absolute value of the entries. 
    d)	A vector of size N × 1 containing the mean of each row. 
    e)	A vector of size N × 1 containing the mean of each column. 
    f)	A matrix of size N × N containing the result of multiplying M with its transpose. 
2.	Write a function that takes a matrix M of size N × N and a real number a as inputs and returns a matrix A of size N × N where the entry A(i, j) is 1 if M(i, j) ≥ a and −1 otherwise.
3.	Test all the functions using the matrix M of size 20×20 with entries given as  M(i, j) = 1/2 (i − j)  where  i, j = 0, ..., 19
4.	Write a program which takes a vector of size N × 1 whose entries are real numbers and sorts it in ascending order.
5.	Write a program which computes prime numbers up to a given maximal number using the iterative algorithm called sieve of Eratosthenes.
Note: - Write the corresponding code in any language without using built-in functions that can directly give the wanted results.

**Answers:**

Writing the corresponding codes in MATLAB without using built-in functions and comparing the non-built-in function results with built-in function results.

1.	Writing a MATLAB function code to compute solution for all sub-questions in question 1.  Function code file is attached below with the name called  **“Assesment_function_code_1.m”**
2.	Writing a MATLAB function code to compute solution for question 2.  Function code file is attached below with the name called **“Assesment_function_code_2.m”**
